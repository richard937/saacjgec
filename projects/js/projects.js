        "description": "There has been a growing need in the past few decades to develop portable power plants for small UAVs and drones in the medium and high altitude range. This lack of appropriate propulsion system has motivated researchers across the globe to research on micro gas turbine engines as a feasible alternative to the currently used piston engines. The performances of piston engines are affected by altitude as there is a significant drop in the power output and increase in the specific fuel consumption with altitude. ",
        "workflow": `The use of single spool micro turbojet engines to power UAVs has attracted enormous attention due to its simplicity in construction, lower production, operation and maintenance costs. The efficiency of existing turbine engines needs to be increased to acceptable levels as the performance of these engines are hampered by small size, low pressure ratios, low Reynolds number and high rotational speeds. A detailed study on the design and analysis of individual components of turbine engines will pave way to better understanding and development of future turbine engines that can propel UAVs and drones. This paper provides detailed design of the major components of a single spool turbojet engine and the mass modelling of the designed engine to estimate its weight. The outcomes of this paper will enable designers to design and manufacture components at a faster rate leading to the elimination of the present disadvantages and effective utilization of this engine to propel drones and UAVs in the near future

        The detailed design of the major components of a Turbojet engine is performed and the dimensions of the components are obtained. Also the weight of individual components of the engine is estimated and thus the total mass of the engine. The knowledge derived from this paper will enable engine designers to quickly design engine components and Turbojet engines in the thrust range of 25N that can power Low and Medium Altitude drones in the near future.`,

        "workflow": `In conventional Rocket bogie system used in NASA, and ESA interplanetary rovers, there are some drawbacks such as less load capacity & low stability due to single pivot point. Those disadvantages can be recovered by this new design. It has the following advantages over other rovers.

We used Convolutional Neural Networks for this purpose, which gave us an accuracy of over 90%.",

It holds a specialized structure along with special and unorthodox techniques of energy flow inside it. Unlike other space hubs, its structure is discrete and can be fully functional if it is divided into its cells or CAPS. Specialized with a CO2 flow energy system it can sustain life at a very low energy level.",

Basically design suggests 11 partitions or CAPS are sufficient to hold a good interactive and research friendly environment for the crew. Besides all its efficiency it has to be assembled in space.It is mainly created to serve men to sustain interplanetary missions or to permanently create an interplanetary civilization. ARMADOROCKET is just an imagination to the future and future men to see them as a galactic species and finding alien life and mainly “TO KNOW MORE”",

        "description": "Auxetic materials are a special kind of material having a negative Poisson’s ratio. When one of the dimensions is reduced it increases its other dimensions. As the material is not so common in nature it needs to be synthesized. It is mainly done in the form of fibers and foams. It is not the base material which is important but the geometry of the cells which produces certain properties.",
        "workflow": `This article reviews some unique properties and usage of this material, computation of Poisson Ratio of one of the most accepted structure i.e. the Auxetic Honeycomb (Re-entrant) in both 2-D and 3-D direction by the software ANSYS followed by its comparison with the Conventional Honeycomb. (1)-Hexagonal Reentrant structure (2)-Internal angles of conventional honeycomb(left) and Auxetic honeycomb (right) The hexagonal Reentrant structure is the most common one. Most of the auxetic materials have Hexagonal structure like bow-tie.(2)These hexagons become squarer when stretched in perpendicular direction.(1)This is also known as auxetic-Honeycombs. It can also be viewed as a conventional Honey-Comb structure having internal angles in negative direction as shown in figure 2. Helical Auxetic Yarns: Another type of auxetic material that has attracted the attention to the scientific community is the helical auxetic yarn. A helical auxetic yarn is developed by combining two fibrous components in a double helix (Hook et al., 20006).[10] This helical auxetic yarn is a novel structure consisting of two components: an elastic core and a stiff wrap in the form of helically wound structure. In this structure higher modulus fiber like carbon fiber is helically wound around the lower modulus core likenylon.[8] Therefore, if we apply tensile force in it the stiff wrap fiber is straightened which further results in displacing the core laterally in a helical manner. Thus, the lower modulus nylon core fibers change their position and gets wrapped around the wrap fibers, which further results in a lateral expansion of the yarn dimension. Hence, an auxetic effect is observed.
