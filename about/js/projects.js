    "solid propulsion" : {
        "description": "A solid rocket is a rocket with an engine that uses solid propellants (fuel /Oxidizer).The earliest rockets were solid fuel rockets powered by gunpowder .Solid rockets are still used today in military armaments and model rockets worldwide. A solid propellant consists of several chemical ingredients such as oxidizer, fuel, binder, plasticizer, curing agent, stabilizer, and cross-linking agent.",
        "workflow": "In a solid rocket, the fuel and oxidizer are mixed together into a solid propellant which is packed into a solid cylinder. A hole through the cylinder serves as a combustion chamber. When the mixture is ignited, combustion takes place on the surface of the propellant. A flame front is generated which burns into the mixture. The combustion produces great amounts of exhaust gas at high temperature and pressure. The amount of exhaust gas that is produced depends on the area of the flame front and engine designers use a variety of hole shapes to control the change in thrust for a particular engine. The hot exhaust gas is passed through a nozzle which accelerates the flow.",

Liquid propellants during the main stages of engines. But to get better results and for intergalactic travel more research is required.",

    "reusuable rocket" : {
        "description": "Rockets are meant to follow the VTHL mechanism instead of the horizontal take off followed by the airplanes.The vertical take off is due to the thrust needed by the rocket to reach the escape velocity and to overcome the atmospheric friction to break out into space.Currently the landing mechanism involves four stage  separation of the carrier vehicle and horizontal landing following recollection and refurbishment.This leads to the wastage of vehicle as well as leads to high maintenance cost.The vertical landing approach has been in the experimental stage and is the future of the rocket landing mechanism leading to the controlled use and reuse of rockets.Most space launchers are profoundly wasteful.",
        "workflow": "This is where the utility of the vertical landing rockets kicks in. The much fancier ways of the horizontal rockets  result in lesser efficiency of rocket maintenance as well as result in higher amount of cash flow. With the advent of various organisations that are significantly trying to achieve the successful descent of vertically landing rockets it is possible that in the near future more number of such launch vehicles will be available in the space scenario.These reusable launch vehicles or RLV’s as we can call it are the next big step towards the space exploration missions that are taking place now.Most significant developments can be said as the Falcon 9 by NASA and ADMIRE by ISRO which is under testing stage.",

        "workflow": `To place India to that platform trans lunar mission has given a major part. As we go through it's trajectory the main factors:
        1. The satellite must gain the escape velocity. 
        2. When it reaches out from earth's gravitational field and centrifugal force it 1st puts itself in perigee position. 
        3.then it transfer itself to GTO( geostationary transfer orbit) 
        4.then it's placed in Apogee. 
        5.atlast after completing it's trans projectile motion to moon it manages to become familiar with the moon's centrifugal force and start rotation in lunar orbit.
        It is a rough sketch we have tried to make.

It holds a specialized structure along with special and unorthodox techniques of energy flow inside it. Unlike other space hubs, its structure is discrete and can be fully functional if it is divided into its cells or CAPS. Specialized with a CO2 flow energy system it can sustain life at a very low energy level.",
        "workflow": "This type of mega structure can be joined with an interplanetary mission. Structural design is completely based upon an Armadillo and that’s why it got a name like this. Basically design suggests 11 partitions or CAPS are sufficient to hold a good interactive and research friendly environment for the crew. Besides all its efficiency it has to be assembled in space.It is mainly created to serve  men to sustain interplanetary missions or to permanently create an interplanetary civilization. ARMADOROCKET is just an imagination to the future and future men to see them as a galactic species and finding alien life and mainly “TO KNOW MORE”",

        "description": "Basic principle behind radar is simple - extremely short bursts of radio energy (travelling at the speed of light) are transmitted, reflected off a target and then returned as an echo. In this modern era such a kind of object detection and measuring system is highly required that uses a wave which can penetrate clouds,smoke, dust or any type of weather even have day and night operation capabilities.",
        "workflow": "So, the reason behind the usage of ultrasonic sensors is to have similarities with the radio wave that is used by modern days Radar systems.In,this case this sensor has a range of 2cm-400cm. This small project can give a very high impact when this same idea would be implemented for a much larger range,thus primarily it will boost up the safety.",

    "auxetic structure" : {
        "description": "  	Auxetic materials are a special kind of material having a negative Poisson’s ratio. When one of the dimensions is reduced it increases its other dimensions. As the material is not so common in nature it needs to be synthesized. It is mainly done in the form of fibers and foams. It is not the base material which is important but the geometry of the cells which produces certain properties.",
        "workflow": ` This article reviews some unique properties and usage of this material, computation of Poisson Ratio of one of the most accepted structure i.e. the Auxetic Honeycomb (Re-entrant) in both 2-D and 3-D direction by the software ANSYS followed by its comparison with the Conventional Honeycomb.
        (1)-Hexagonal Reentrant structure     (2)-Internal angles of conventional                                                                      honeycomb(left)  and  Auxetic honeycomb (right)
                             The hexagonal Reentrant structure is the most common one. Most of the auxetic materials have Hexagonal structure like bow-tie.(2)These hexagons become squarer when stretched in perpendicular direction.(1)This is also known as auxetic-Honeycombs. It can also be viewed as a conventional Honey-Comb structure having internal angles in negative direction as shown in figure 2.

                           Another type of auxetic material that has attracted the attention to the scientific community is the helical auxetic yarn. A helical auxetic yarn is developed by combining two fibrous components in a double helix (Hook et al., 20006).[10] This helical auxetic yarn is a novel structure consisting of two components: an elastic core and a stiff wrap in the form of helically wound structure. In this structure higher modulus fiber like carbon fiber is helically wound around the lower modulus core likenylon.[8] Therefore, if we apply tensile force in it the stiff wrap fiber is straightened which further results in displacing the core laterally in a helical manner. Thus, the lower modulus nylon core fibers change their position and gets wrapped around the wrap fibers, which further results in a lateral expansion of the yarn dimension. Hence, an auxetic effect is observed.

    "gimble" : {
        "description": "Most modern rockets rotate or gimbal the nozzle to produce the control torque.In a gimbaled thrust system, the exhaust nozzle of the rocket can be swiveled from side to side. As the nozzle is moved, the direction of the thrust is changed relative to the centre of gravity of the rocket, which results in producing torque which further leads to providing the right and appropriate trajectory easily and thus reduces human effort to a bit.",
        "workflow": "This material is nothing but a hydraulic actuator attached to the upper portion of the thruster and the body of the rocket. This moves the thruster freely in a certain direction to a certain angle with the vertical and thus produces the torque by moving the nose of the rocket. This mechanism produces a thrust known as gimbal thrust. Modern rockets like the space shuttle,Falcon 9,the Saturn v lunar rockets are using this mechanism to reduce the human effort to produce the torque and provide the proper trajectory easily.",
